Real or Fake News Prediction System
!News

Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting real and fake news articles. Whether you‚Äôre interested in media literacy, combating misinformation, or simply curious about the power of natural language processing (NLP), this project provides valuable insights.

Features:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Load historical news data from ‚Äòtrain.csv‚Äô, examine its structure, handle duplicate rows and missing values, and merge relevant columns.
Text Vectorization: Use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model to classify news articles as real or fake.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model‚Äôs performance using accuracy scores, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualize the confusion matrix.
Making Predictions on New Data: Create a predictive system to classify news articles based on the trained model. Import test data from ‚Äòtest.csv‚Äô, preprocess it, and apply the model to make predictions. Save predictions to a CSV file (‚Äòtest_predictions.csv‚Äô).

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project includes labeled news articles (real or fake). You can find it in the data directory.
